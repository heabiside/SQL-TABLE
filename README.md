# What is this?
This is a PHP source code that outputs a reasonably readable table when you enter a SQL statement.

# Example usage
I built it in xampp, which is vulnerable because I don't intend to publish it as a web app.
If you put the whole folder directly under htdocs, it works just like the pictures below.



Thank you!
